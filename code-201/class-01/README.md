# Reading Assignment

## Semantic HTML

> HTML always (and only) provides structure and content, never appearance

- Semantic Markup: `<tags>` describe what the content within is
- Tags are surrounded by angle brackets `<>`
- Tags must be closed
  - Self Closing: `<img />`
  - Surrounding Content: `<span>Words</span>`
- Tags can have attributes to describe in more detail
  - `<img height="300" />`

## Javascript Conditionals

> Allow us to make decisions in our code and do different things based on whether something is true or false.

"IF it is raining, THEN put on a raincoat, OTHERWISE just go out"

```javascript
var wearingCoat = '';
if(isRaining === true) {
  wearingCoat = "yes";
}
else {
  wearingCoat = "nope!";
}
```
